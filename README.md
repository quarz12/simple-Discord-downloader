# simple-Discord-downloader

This is a simple python script that downloads all images from given Discord channels using Discords http API.

To use it you need to set the token variable to your discord token.

Next you run the script with all the channelids you want to download as parameters.

You can find a good explanation on how to get these values here: https://github.com/Dracovian/Discord-Scraper/blob/experimental/README.md
